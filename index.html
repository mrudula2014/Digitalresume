          <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
      </div>

      <p>“A great team player [Jyothyraj] was easy to work with on projects and which she contributed to immensely. [Jyothyraj] is quick to grasp and apply technical concepts... she was a vital part of the exam study groups and ensured everybody was carried along, in addiIon, her background in educaIon really shone through during these sessions. I am confident that any organisaIon [Jyothyraj] works with will quickly come to realise they are lucky to have her as she quickly establishes herself as an integral part of any team.”
